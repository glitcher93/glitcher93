# Hi everyone! I'm Nigel!

Welcome to my github profile!

## About Me

I'm a veteran Line Cook turned into a full-stack Web Developer! I spent 12 years of my life in the restaurant industry and discovered coding through one of my best friends. I started out by teaching myself JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and discovered that - in addition to having an aptitude for programming - I loved it. In 2021, I decided to formalize my education by taking BrainStation's Web Development bootcamp. Shortly thereafter, I was nominated and hired as a Teaching Assistant for their January 2022 cohort. I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge and build exciting projects!
